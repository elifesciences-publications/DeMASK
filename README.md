## **De**terminstic **M**odeling for **A**nalysis of complicated **S**ingle molecule **K**inetics

This package was designed to assist those attempting to understand complicated single molecule kinetics by arming them with tools to test kinetic models and fit microscopic rate constants. To use this tool, you must perform dwell time analysis and generate cumulative distributions of dwell times.
